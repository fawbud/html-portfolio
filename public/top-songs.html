<h1>Top Songs of 2024</h1>
<h2>Top songs according to Billboard's Hot 100</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Ariana Grande, “Yes, And?”</h3>
<p>This is the eighth Grande song to top the chart and her sixth to debut at
    number-one. It also makes history for producer Max Martin, who achieves
    his 24th number-one hit, the most of any producer in Hot 100 history.
    Half of Grande’s chart-toppers have been collaborations. This is just
    her fourth hit to reach the summit without another credited artist,
    following “Thank U Next,” “7 Rings” and “Positions.”</p>
<h3>2. Jack Harlow, “Lovin on Me”</h3>
<p>After all the holiday songs dropped off the chart in the week after Christmas,
    Harlow’s single leaped up from number-nine back to number-one after previously
    spending a week on top in December. It’s his third chart-topper, following
    “Industry Baby” with Lil Nas X and “First Class.” It’s also his longest-running
    chart-topper.</p>
<h3>3. Brenda Lee, “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree”</h3>
<p>The classic holiday song reached number-one during the 2023 holiday season.
    It was the song’s first time ever at the top a remarkable 65 years after
    its release way back in 1958. This is just the third holiday song ever to
    top the chart, following The Chipmunks and David Seville’s “The Chipmunk
    Song” and Mariah Carey‘s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” It’s also
    Brenda Lee’s third song to reach the pinnacle. “Rockin’ Around” spent a
    total of three weeks on top during this competitive holiday period.</p>
